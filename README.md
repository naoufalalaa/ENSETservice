### First let's understand the concept of it all

I was approached by the backend developer to make a template for his application powered by _**GoLang**_. Basically the application was all done, the choice was to not use API for different reasons otherwise we'd be using reactJS or VueJs for frontend rendering.

For the developement of the template, as you would know if you ever checked my other projects, I use **UIKIT** and that is due to its compatibility with bootstrap which I decided not to use. 

UIkit gives a large hand of technical choices and it is easier to manipulate than other web ui frameworks.
